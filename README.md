# Clustered Experiments Reanalysis using Machine Learning Techniques
This project demonstrates the ability to reanalyze a clustered dataset from a previously published experimental study using machine learning techniques. The goal is to compare the performance of the new approach to the original analysis, assessing potential improvements in accuracy and precision.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

pandas
NumPy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Dataset
To use this code, you will need a clustered dataset from a previously published experimental study. The dataset should have a limited number of experimental units (e.g., villages, hospitals) but detailed information on a larger number of individuals (e.g., villagers, doctors). Replace the placeholder path in the pd.read_csv() function with the path to your dataset.

Running the Code
- Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
- Open the project in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
- Replace the dataset path in the pd.read_csv() function with the path to your dataset.
- Update the data preprocessing, feature engineering, and original analysis replication steps based on the specifics of your chosen dataset and study.
- Run the code to train the machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
- Project Structure

The project consists of the following main steps:

Dataset selection and preprocessing
Replication of the original analysis
Feature engineering
Machine learning model selection and training
Model evaluation and comparison
Results visualization and interpretation
Project documentation and presentation
